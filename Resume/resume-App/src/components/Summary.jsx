      As a designer, I highly value the ability to bring a clientâ€™s vision to life, which is very <br></br>
      rewarding. There is a huge amount of satisfaction I gain from seeing a piece of work <br />
      from idea to design, especially when it appears in the user hands. I believe the<br />
      user-centred solutions are the most valuable future digital resources.
